  "description": "Learn the best techniques for strap-on sex. Lady January Frost demonstrates vaginal, oral, and anal sex\u2013featuring Kay Kardia\u2019s\nfirst time anal experience ever!\n. Learn pro-Domme tips for choosing and using a strap-on harness and dildos, and even how to use rope to fashion a quick and effective strap-on harness.\n\nA note about gender terminology in this tutorial:\n_When we use the terms male bodied and female bodied we are talking about body parts. In particular, when we are talking about harnesses and strap ons one consideration somebody might make is if the wearer has a penis or does not have a penis and that may impact their choice in products. There are products that will work with and without penises, but this is a consideration.\n\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll use the term male bodied and female bodied to talk about body parts but please know that we are using this language to talk about body parts and not identities here. For example when we talk about male bodied we are referencing a person that has a penis and when we talk about a female bodied we are referencing someone with a vulva. We recognize that not all people with penises identify as male or men, but in this class we will be using the term male bodied to reference someone with a penis._",
