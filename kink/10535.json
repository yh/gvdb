  "description": "This is not replacing your weekly updates. Sometimes months will have more Wednesdays then there are live show updates. This Friday you can enjoy the delectable Misti Dawn. April\u2019s live show will begin updating on May 4th. So revisit this never before seen bondage scene and come back Friday for your regular scheduled shoot.\n\nBy now, you probably know that Chloe Camilla is a sweet little angel-faced beauty with a pristine all-natural body and an almost magical innocence. You probably also know that this inspires in us some seriously dark urges. Repression is bad for your health, so we\u2019re going to go ahead and indulge ourselves today.\n\nIn the spirit of going for it, we create a simple metal device to bolt our blond darling to the ceiling. With her arms and legs spread wide, we leave Chloe totally prone and totally helpless, about 10 feet from the safety of the ground.\n\nWe flog her perfect little shaved pussy and tender pink-tipped tits. We tease her with the vibe mercilessly, as Chloe makes adorable frustrated grunts and squeaks. We clamp her nipples, hook her tight ass and add weight - a lot - to both. We tease her some more with the vibe, whip her tits when the clamps fall off, then re-clamp them. When we do let Chloe have orgasm, she forgets her manners. We break out the hose to teach our ungrateful little slut a lesson. Teaching can be a most gratifying occupation.",
