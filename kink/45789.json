  "description": "\u201cMy first scene was like a dream. It was my first time sharing sexual intercourse with my Dominant The King Noire, and just like before every performance, I was nervous and excited. Before we began, my King inquired about my shirt which read; \u201cBuilt for Destruction\u201d. It was actually my elder brother\u2019s old shirt. When I saw that he\u2019d discarded it I snagged it up and cropped it. My King\u2019s next question was \u201cWhat would you like me to destroy?\u201d After an out of place nervous giggle, I respond, \u201cMy fear, King Sir\u201d, and he did just that.\nI was lost in him. Though there were 5 people in the room and my first time having intercourse with filming onlookers, all I saw was him. Besides the occasional reminder, I often forgot there was anyone else there. That\u2019s how I think sex should be - present. It was beautiful. Like a dream. A beautiful set, with a beautiful, caring man and a fantastic supportive crew. How fortunate can I be?\u201d\nFilmed & Photographed by: Honey Suckle Magazine & Honey Ronit",
