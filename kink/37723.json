Sometimes called edging or surfing, orgasm control is coming just up to the point of orgasm without achieving climax, often staying at the point just prior to orgasm for an extended period. Lady Frost discusses and demonstrates how to edge your female or male partner, or even yourself\u2026to help achieve the most extended and mind-blowing orgasms possible.\n\nIn this tutorial you\u2019ll learn:\n-What is the purpose of orgasm control\n-How can it be used during BDSM or Dom/sub play\n-How is it achieved in both males and females\n-How edging can help solve premature ejaculation\n-How it can help you and your partner achieve simultaneous (even multiple) orgasms\n-What are the effects on the body?\n\nUse this tool that every body possesses to prolong pleasure, intensify orgasm, and extend play with your partner.",
