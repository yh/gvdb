When he reveals his amnesia, Suzuran, the head maid, tells him that he\u2019s here for a reason. She tells him that he\u2019ll be able to return to where he came from only when he can overcome his personal issues. The maids are there to help him resolve this, however since Akio has no memory, he has no idea what personal issues he needs to resolve.",
