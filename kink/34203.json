  "description": "House Dom Connor Maguire finally steps up to the 30 Minutes of Torment challenge. The Bamboo Garden - Connor starts things off brutally, tied to bamboo chutes. Van works the muscled studs chest with some hard punches before caning his ass. With his cock hard, and tied up Connor endures more caning and nipple torment. The Pit - Strapped up with belts and balancing on pegs, Connor takes the flogging of his life as Van wields two floggers. We\u2019ve seen him dish it out but the hunk can really take a beating too. With a dildo mounted on the platform, Connor squats on to it, enduring the ass torment as well as the stress position with another round of hard flogging mixed in. The Water Station - With Connor\u2019s entire torso feeling the agonizing pinch of the numerous clothes pins we hit him hard with the water. Each clothes pin is held by twine causing it to pull on the stud\u2019s flesh whenever he tries to avoid the intense spray. After a round of breath play Connor has gotten through his 30 minutes and cums hard after the day\u2019s session.",
