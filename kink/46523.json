  "description": "Dr Fires had received a emergency call from Robbie\u2019s Robot Cabaret. One of their star dancers Trixie had malfunctioned and froze on stage. Robbie the owner was freaking out. Dr Fires decided to take the repair call herself instead of one of her techs. She wanted to see why her androids were having some many problems at that establishment. Dr Fires arrives at the club to find Trixie frozen and non operational. Robbie was surprised to see Dr. Fires in person and tried to explain what happened. She did not want to hear from him but the robot herself. She shoos him away and begins to run some diagnostic tests on Trixie. Dr Fires will soon find out why Trixie has been malfunctioning and why she is the star dancer!\n\nCast: CaberetBot, Dr. Ashley Fires",
