  "description": "Blonde haired, blue eyed, all natural Ash Hollywood is on a mission to write a smear piece about Kink.com exploiting its models. But Mistress Isis Love takes a personal interest in showing the Armory\u2019s facilities and how its subs are treated \u00e2\u20ac\u201d by turning Ash into one! Isis subjects this small-tittied slut to a full electro-torment tour. First she\u2019s subjected to the zapper, cattle prod and shocking metal clothes pins with sticky pads, all while her pussy is tormented by an acrylic plug-in pleaser.\n\nAsh struggles to keep some distance from her subject, but Love insists on continuing this sub\u2019s hands-on demonstration with EMS pads as the samurai dildo slams her tender, wet cunt, and turning the zapper on her feet and toes.\n\nIsis then turns her attention to shocking Ash\u2019s ass with copper wire and electric clover clamps. The mistress concludes her Q-and-A with Ash, wielding the plug-in electric toy as a strap-on. The next time Ash fires up her laptop, you can be sure she\u2019ll be fair and balanced!",
