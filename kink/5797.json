A season that promises everything you have come to love and more.\n\nAriel \u201cThe Assassin\u201d X is ranked #1 going into the fist stage of season 6. She is tiny but powerful; small but tenacious. Ariel brings determination and hard work to the mat every time she wrestles. She can love you and hurt you at the same time.\n\nAmi Emerson is a big (5\u20197) strong redhead and is in great shape. Before the match she looked at Ariel and cockily said \u201cI\u2019m wrestling that little thing?\u201d Ami had to be tough growing up with an older brother. She was the sexy tomboy who thought she was all that.\n\nBut cocky Ami got beat down! She was made to submit to the little girl, fingered by the little girl, and then in RD 4, fucked by the little girl. Ariel even took the vibrator to the bound loser in RD4 and made her cum until the bigger girl was begging for it to stop! Who\u2019s your daddy now!?",
