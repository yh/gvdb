  "description": "So when a MEMBER writes in and says: I'm a 20 year old female and member to Hogtied. I discovered bondage about 2 years ago. I've had some light scenes and some heavier scenes with a select group of doms. I've also had some vanilla contact with women and I've discovered that I enjoy that as well. Right now, nobody has been able to calm my desire to be tied up and, well...used. I think that doing this would help me discover more about me and about bondage in general. I am, of course, very willing when it comes to bondage...I've been told that I am a natural submissive. I have realized, through my adventures, that I respond amazingly well to pain! If you need more pictures to make your decision, please let me know. What do you do? I think you do what we just did. Any other Members out there that want to give it a try?",
