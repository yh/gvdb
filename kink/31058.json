She is currently the only active wrestler on the roster to have ever won a summer vengeance tournament.\n\nWenona missed season 9 but she\u2019s back and more tone and sexy than ever. She blasted her last opponent with a blow out victory. She has more mat time on the U/S than syd does. She\u2019s wrestled for 3 seasons longer than syd. Wenona is confident that her having more experience with U/S rules will definitely play its part in her victory today.\n\nBONUS OIL MATCH\nand a super sexy spanking.
