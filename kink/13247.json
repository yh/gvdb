Samantha impressed us this year and got ranked ahead of her undefeated opponent. Samantha is in the best shape of her career. This formal gymnast is looking for her first ever Tournament win.\n\nJesse Cox is a returning undefeated veteran. This tiny ball of muscle is also a former gymnast. This is Jesse\u2019s second SV tournament and she is looking for her first tournament win as she was eliminated in the first round last year.\n\nExperience won the day. With more mat time than Samantha, Jesse took the early lead and never let it go. However both girls got their licks in. Both girls were [REDACTED] to submit to the other as both have legs of steel. Both girls tasted the pain of being trapped in the body scissors. It was just a matter of time until one of them submitted to the pain. In the end Jesse held on to the victory and got to brutally fuck and humiliate her beautiful opponent.",
