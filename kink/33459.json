  "description": "Lance and Bella are having issues. SEXUAL issues. Good thing they live in San Francisco, where practicing psychologist Dr. Wolf Hudson is excepting new clients. Lance and Bella confront their struggle with his changing desires and speak frankly about his curiosity with cuckolding and his new habit of wearing a male chastity device under his clothes. Bella is fed up and pissed off that her husband keeps his cock locked away, and claims that her marital needs are NOT being met.\n\nDr. Hudson leads the couple through three unusual exercises where Bella is shown specialized techniques in dominance and submission including ball busting, flogging, spanking, pegging, and cuckolding. With the help of Wolf\u2019s RAGING HARD COCK, Bella and Lance rekindle their romance and decide couples therapy is definitely worth the price of private practice.",
