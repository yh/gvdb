  "description": "Once a Cyberdine Android she has been reengineered and modified by the HRX Corporation. Originally designed and programmed to be a sexy and dominant Mistress, her Master would now like her to be his Submissive Slave. But a simple reprogramming would not suffice. She would have to be totally reengineered and retrofitted. She was given new dermal platting for her skin and strengthen her chassis so she may be able to withstand serve floggings and canings. And a whole new orgasm control capabilities. Once finished with her new upgrades and programming they had the new SlaveBot identify herself. Her new robot submissive slave name is Meg or Megan, she answers to either name. She is asked a few questions and there were some minor glitches. Now they had to perform a stress test to see if she would be able to hold up. She performed well for the first few tests but then she has a major malfunction and they are had to shut her down and reboot. They start the tests again. Once finished with her flogging and spanking she was made to have a very powerful orgasm. Satisfied with Meg\u2019s performance they are confident that her Master will enjoy his new Submissive Slave Slut!",
