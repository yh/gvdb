  "description": "Plan A is to have a dom work over Patrick Rouge and newcomer Tommy Defendi. Tommy is more of a top but he\u2019s new to bondage, so he\u2019s willing to sub once to see what it\u2019s like. But on the morning of the shoot, our dom is a no-show. Since Tommy has no dom training, I decide to step in and save the shoot: Plan B. Sure, bondage is hot, but I also love messing with the subs\u2019 heads, as you\u2019ll see in this update. I also like to give them options: \u201cWhere do you want me to hit you? Here? There?\u201d It keeps them focused and out of their headspace and prevents them from \u201cleaving the room.\u201d There are a million doms out there and each has their own style. I like my sessions to be sensual, erotic, and firm. And as Daddy Zeus from Zeus Studios suggests, \u201cStop saying \u2018Good Boy.\u2019 \u201c It\u2019s a damn hard habit to break after ten plus years. Sincerely, Van Darkholme",
