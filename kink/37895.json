  "description": "Hot boy next door Jackson Fillmore joins Men on Edge Live to try out puppy play for the first time. He jumps right into the role, submitting to Christian and Sebastian as soon as the puppy mask goes on. Christian leads Jackson around on a short leash and has the pup worship his boots while Sebastian hogties him. Jackson is made to wear a rawhide bone on his balls as they edge him repeatedly, getting suggestions from the members. Jackson is even made to suck his own dick in a piledriver. Sebastian and Christian take Jackson to the bed, bending the eager pup over and toying his his hairy asshole. Jackson may not be allowed to cum yet, but Christian takes the opportunity to blow a load all over Jackson\u2019s face. Flipped over Jackson endures an alternate between torment and pleasure as he\u2019s relentlessly tickled. An even bigger pup tail plug is inserted before Jackson finally gets to blow his load, obediently lapping up his cum from Sebastian\u2019s hand. Helpless to move, Jackson\u2019s finished off with a vicious tickling and apple polishing on his sensitive, uncut cockhead.",
