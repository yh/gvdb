Then Nerine demonstrates some of the erotic capabilities of bootblacking by topping her bootblacking model Mike Panic with some CBT (Cock & Ball Torment) and a boot wax handjob. Then she straps a dildo onto his boot and rides him for her ow pleasure.\n\nWhether you\u2019re considering boot & leather care as a useful craft for your own boots, a service to your Master or slave, or even as a skilled trade for money, this tutorial teaches you both the heart and sole.",
