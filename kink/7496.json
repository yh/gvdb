  "description": "It was Friday the 13th and we should have known better. Naked Kombat's first tag team match with Spencer Reed and DJ taking on Patrick Rouge and Dean Tucker. We took over the Ultimate Surrender mat for this event. With 60 screaming audience members, the event was also streamed live over the internet. Adrenaline pumped, the fighters went all out and neither team wanted to lose. Unfortunately, injuries took hold during the match and two fighters had to drop out. There was a two on one in the 3rd Round, then a one on one in the Sex Round. Spencer sprayed his load all over the mat and the crowd went wild.\nFor those who enjoyed the audience match, sadly this is our last. We've had 3 live audience matches and there were injuries in all three. On a happy note, I spoke to the injured boys and they are fully recovered and looking forward to their next match. Sincerely, Van",
