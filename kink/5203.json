Three 12-minute non-scripted wrestling rounds.\nThen the last round where the winners tie up, dominate, humiliate, and brutally fuck the losers.\n\nThe first match was all we had hoped it would be. 36 minutes of grueling wrestling, multiple lead changes, great fingering, and submission holds. Amazing 2 on 1 action as well as 2 on 2 action. The winner was decided in the last minute, with the winning team winning by only 17pts! The final Score was 586 to 569. But which team came out on top? Which team is going to get fucked? And who\u2019s going to get it in the ass?\n\nJoin now and get in on the ground floor of this exciting new sport, as the TAG TEAM LEAGUE launches today!",
