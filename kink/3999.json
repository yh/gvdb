  "description": "The Jester is currently ranked 8th. In 7 full matches she has 5 losses and has not caused one opponent to submit. She likes to smack talk, but has been unable to back it up on the mat.\n\nThe Killer lost her first match against the Pirate. The Pirate was so impressed with her first time performance she gave her \u2018The Killer\u201d nickname. The Killer has been the only wrestler to come into the US studio for practice sessions. I was impressed with her first match so much I ranked her 4th so far this season. A ranking that has drawn criticism. So is the killer for real or was the Pirate just rusty from her long injury break?",
