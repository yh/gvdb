  "description": "Penny Barber has been impressive this season. She was given the opportunity to be in the Welter Weight Semi finals against Isamar when Mistress Kara had to step down due to an injury. She didn\u2019t do so well against the now Champion, Isamar, but she\u2019s been doing great with everyone else.\nBella Rossi has been hit or miss. She\u2019s extremely impressive in the tag team matches, easily reversing control and racking up points for her team but her performance in the welterweight tournament wasn\u2019t so outstanding. These two were not seeded to meet in the WW tournament so we are glad to see them meet today in the Summer Vengeance tournament.\n\nThis is back and forth action non stop. Both these Wreslters want to move on badly. Bella wants to win Penny just to win Penny and Penny wants to win so she can meet up with Syd ( her arch nemesis this season) We are pretty sure Syd wants Penny to win this won as well so she can hand her ass to her when they meet in their match.\nThis score is close to the bitter end. Just when you think one of the wrestlers has it in the bag, the other gets control and finger blasts her to tears almost. But neither ever give up. It\u2019s bitterly close and when they look up to see the score at the final buzzer, emotionals are at an all time high.",
