  "description": "Competitiveness weeds out the wheat from the chaff in any profession. If you\u2019re complacent and comfortable, you\u2019ll let your skills stagnate and ambition will atrophy. There\u2019s always openings for new Dommes at Electrosluts and I pit two would-be Tops in a battle royale for the opening.\n\nThe rules: they both have access to the same electrosex equipment, the same restraints and they will be judged on their creativity, ability and skill to restrain the sub and talent to make her submit.\n\nIn one corner, I have Lorelei Lee, aka \u201cThe Veteran.\u201d In the other, Sinn Sage, or \u201cThe Underdog.\u201d In the middle of The Competition (as I like to call it), Kristina Rose, the submissive test bed for their dark creativity. Sinn has first crack at Kristina, then Lorelei Lee shows off her chops.\n\nKristina proves herself to be a tough sub to crack for both Sinn and Lorelei, this is The Competition, after all. However, rules don\u2019t stop the two determined would be Eletrosluts Dommes from making their mark on Kristina. Watch and see what happens when two hot-headed Dommes are pushed competitively and how they make their sub submit.",
