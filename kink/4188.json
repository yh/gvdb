  "description": "The Nightmare is finally back after her early season knee injury; she injured the knee at her training facility. The Nightmare is pissed she lost last season\u2019s title to the Ninja, and is now healthy and ready to reign holy terror once again on the US mat.\n\nThe Shark was welcomed to US in her last match by the veteran Isis \u201cThe Goddess\u201d Love. If she thought that was a welcome to US then what will she think after this week? The Sharked is made to submit 5 times, and is made to orgasm during wrestling. Then if she though Isis was brutal with the strap on\u2026.",
