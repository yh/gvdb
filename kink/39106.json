  "description": "Learn how to get in touch with your animalistic self and turn your body into a tool for pinning, restraining, or otherwise restricting your partner, regardless of your gender or size. Kalisti demonstrates safe techniques for biting and scratching. You\u2019ll also learn several holds, pressure points, queening (dominant face-sitting), and see lots of examples as to ways primal play can be used in and out of the bedroom. This lesson also talks about \u201cswitching\u201d as to whom is in control during the scene/sexual encounter if both partners are dominant.",
