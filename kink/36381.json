  "description": "Muffing is an erotic and unusual form of penetration. Involving insertion of a finger into one or both of the inguinal canals. It is a sexual technique popularized by trans women, and is unique in that it is completely dry. No bodily fluids are involved. It requires the inverting of scrotal tissue and pushing it up into the cavity (or cavities) through which the testes descended before birth or in early childhood. In some ways, muffing has more in common with CBT (Cock & Ball Torture) rater than finger fucking, but there certainly is penetration involved, usually up to the second knuckle on a finger. Kink University is proud to demystify and share this unique technique, presented by famed trans author and educator, Tobi Hill-Meyer.",
