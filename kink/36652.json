  "description": "This tutorial demonstrates deliberate bondage-induced pain and its effect on the human body, both physically and mentally. Rope can be used for great pleasure and for great pain, and can have a transcending effect on the body and mind. Boss Bondage explains these facets and how rope play can blur the line that separates them. The video shows how to safely use different ties, implements, and techniques, as well as using thinner rope and strategically less of it to administer dynamic elements of pain, sensation, control, and even pleasure.\nBoss describes how there is something very exciting about twisting, contorting, yanking and pulling someone for your own satisfaction. He also covers how this play affects safety.",
