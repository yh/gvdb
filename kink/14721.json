  "description": "Welcome to Tag Team Tuesdays. Totally non-scripted, all in front of a live audience, all broadcast live to members. Today\u2019s update is RD 2 of 4.\n\nWith Kiki Koi injured in the first round, Rain DeGrey steps out of the crowd to join The Dragons. Ultimate Surrender is a non-scripted rough sport. The choice was add Rain to the team or suspend the match. We chose to continue the show and now the Dragons have an advantage of talent.\n\nCan The Ninjas hang on to their lead? Will Rain tip the balance of the match in the Dragons\u2019 favor? Or will they reach even deeper and pull out an upset? Anything is possible.",
