  "description": "Fear should be distinguished from, but is closely related to, the emotion anxiety, which occurs as the result of threats which are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable. This holds true as we watch Holly bound in the scavenger\u2019s daughter and electricity is introduced. She is completely helpless and no matter what her brain is telling her, she has to face this fear.\n\nSensory deprivation or perceptual isolation is the deliberate reduction or removal of stimuli from one or more of the senses. This technique is more than adequate for the purposes of scene 2. Take away her sight, and she has to depend on her other senses, which deceive her into thinking that it\u2019s much worse than it really is.\n\nImmobilized is to deprive of the capacity for mobilization. Holly is completely helpless to anything that is coming in scene 3. Every part of her body is locked under strict steel and then wrapped to reduce any minor movement she may still have had. The pain continues along with brutal ass and pussy orgasm until she is unable to continue.",
