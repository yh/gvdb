  "description": "Learn how to build a powerful connection of intimacy with your partner by using a variety of transitions in your rope bondage. This tutorial uses the simplest of rope techniques to create a rope scene, and focuses on context rather than the mechanics of specific ties. With Tifereth as his model, rigger Cannon shows how to use breath, touch, body manipulation, tension, and above all, rope transitions, to create a deeply connective bondage experience. Requires three 25-30 ft. long ropes, about quarter-inch diameter (8m long by 5mm diameter).",
