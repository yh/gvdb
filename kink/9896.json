  "description": "Welcome to the the Quarter Finals of the 2010 Summer Vengeance Tournament! The top 16 wrestlers battle it out in single elimination!\n\nTIA LING\nJade\nHT: 5\u20191\nWT: 99lbs\nSeason record (1-1)\nRanked 8th\n\nVENDETTA\nVendetta\nHT: 5\u20196\nWT: 135lbs\nSeason record (2-0)\nRanked 4th\n\nTia Ling is one of the smallest wrestlers on the roster. Tia Ling is also one of the strongest wrestlers on the roster. Tia Ling is one of the best conditioned, tough, scrappy wrestlers we have on the roster. Only 5\u20191 and 99lbs, this little smoking hot spitfire is no pushover. When you wrestle with her, you\u2019re in for a battle.\nThat\u2019s what I said last week, and after this match I couldn\u2019t mean it more.\n\nVendetta is the bad girl of Ultimate Surrender, she truly enjoys beating up bitches. But what she hates more then anything on this planet is losing. This Former Summer Vengenace Champinon is looking to make history as being the first person ever to win two titles.\n\nThere is only one thing to really say about this match: If you\u2019re uncomfortable watching brutal non-scripted contact sports, then please, this match is not for you. This was an intense battle of epic proportions. Plus, there is a lot of hardcore gratuitous anal fucking in round 4.",
