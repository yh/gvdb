  "description": "Season Six Match\nBELLA ROSSI\nThe Annihilator\nHT: 5'5\nWT: 155lbs\nSeason record (3-0)\nLifetime record (3-0)\nRanked 6th\nDIA ZERVA\nIron Maiden\nHT: 5'5\nWT: 135lbs\nSeason record (1-0)\nLifetime record (1-0)\nRanked 3rd\nBella is an undefeated rookie with 3 wins to her name. Some think her size and strength make her unbeatable at US. As she gains experience, combined with her size and strength, she just gets tougher and tougher to compete with.\nDia was last year's runner up to the Champion, losing to Syd Blackovich in the final match of the season. She has been absent from the singles matches of late because her team won the Tag Team Championship in February.\nThis match was brutal at least for one competitor, Bella, who got destroyed and whimpered like a baby as crushing leg scissors caused submission after submission. The Annihilator was annihilated and it is brutal to witness.",
