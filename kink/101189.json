Fearful that the Ashley 3000 may overtake any of their current HRX models. The Government decided that they must speed up the progress of project Titan so that it can seek out and destroy the Ashley 3000.\nHRX-0073 has been built for strength and aggression, but because of the sped up process the scientists have not work out a lot the bugs. The software and hardware have been scavenged from various other projects and they are unsure of how it will all work together.\n\nTake an unprecedented look behind closed doors as you follow HRX-0073 (Code Name \u201cTITAN\u201d) from its initial creation through the first few rounds of bug testing. You get to see the scientists of X-Machine Labs brave the hazards of a super strong Fembot on the fritz!",
