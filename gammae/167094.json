  "description": "Step-brothers Dante Colle and Carter Woods are kind of a big deal around the neighborhood, and they've had their pick of the litter when it comes to local tail, so when a new hot neighbor turns up outside, their interest is piqued, to say the least. Elliot Finn's just in for the week while his parents are out of town, and since he doesn't know anyone, he figures it might be a good idea to take the brothers up on their offer to hang out, but when he gets back to their place, he quickly learns just how friendly the neighbors can get. By the time Dante and Carter are done with him, he may want to extend his stay just a little longer.Enjoy!",
