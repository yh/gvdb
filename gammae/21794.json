  "description": "The wedding is off. The grooms have split up and poor Tony Capucci buries his grief. He pours his heart out to Rod Daily and soon learns that when one door closes, another opens. Rod gladly lets his good buddy know that there are a lot of guys who will stand up in lieu of the feckless Andrew, especially him. To his surprise and relief, Tony lets Rod demonstrate just how much he means to him, not only as a friend, but as the desired object of his silent lust. Tony quickly rebounds, running out of his blue funk and into the arms, mouth and asshole of a true soul mate.",
