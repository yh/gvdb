  "description": "Episode 1: Unreal Estate There's only one thing in San Francisco that's as in demand as ass, and that's real estate. In this city, it's all about the view. And Gene (Jesse Santana), one of the hottest brokers in town, has made a mint at it because he knows how to read people. But sometimes, looks can be deceiving. Take Tim (Sage Daniels): his company was just valued at over 100 million, but you couldn't tell by looking at him. Will this be the one deal that Gene isn't capable of closing?",
