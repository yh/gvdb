  "description": "I'm sure all you regulars will remember Jackson just by the mention of his name. Others of you will surely not forget him after you watch his return video in our War Chest Archives. Jackson is a beautiful country boy that I met a couple of years ago while hanging out at my beach house. He was in the USMC back then and was surfing on the beach right in front of my house one morning while I was out walking. I spied this hottie and made it my business to start a conversation with him. Within an hour, he was stripped down naked on my bed revealing a massive cock the size of his longboard.At the time, Jackson was already in some serious trouble with the Marine Corps. His sister had come to visit him in this beach town for a week and ended up falling in love with a Marine Corp Officer. The relationship would prove to be one laced with violence and Jackson would soon find himself in the middle of one of their fights. The story is quite interesting and Jackson does a much better job of telling it than I do. So, head on over to the War Chest and hear Jackson's story and why he ended up having to take matters into his own hands to rescue his sister and how that incident would cause our relationship to be put on the back burner for over two years.",
