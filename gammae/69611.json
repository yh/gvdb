  "description": "Episode 4: Punk Rocks Tyler (Chris Porter) was quiet in college or maybe he was keeping quiet so he could watch while his sexy-as-hell cocky roommate Jimmy (Tommy Defendi) banged girl after girl in their one-room double. The angst -- and whatever else -- that Jimmy had all bottled up in college started pouring out once he came to the city's gritty South of Market district on vacation. Like a moth to a flame, Jimmy found his way to Tyler's show... and Tyler, who's gained a bit of confidence himself since they last saw each other, can't wait to give Jimmy the show of his life.",
