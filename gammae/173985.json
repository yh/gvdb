  "description": "While snooping in the garage, Dacotah Red & Ryan Jordan find a box that says 'Important Documents, Do Not Touch'. Intrigued and nosy, of course the two of them open the box. What they find inside comes as a total shock: they were adopted! At first, they are confused by what they found but then Dacotah comes up with an idea: if they aren't real brothers then that means they can fool around! Ryan is hesitant at first but as soon as they start kissing, things start to heat up. Enjoy!",
