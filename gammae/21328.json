  "description": "As head commandant of the compound it is Zak Spears's duty to ensure that all the men -- soldiers and prisoners alike -- bend to his will. Four prisoners made the mistake of trying to escape and their treason has to be addressed. With Cliff Parker and Scott Davis serving as meat-beating watchmen, the enraged Colonel dominates the frightened quartet. In the meantime, Shawn is alone in Zak's office and his curiosity gets the better of him. He opens the lockbox and finds info and sizzling evidence that arouses his libido. He questions his loyalties and impetuously acts upon his carnal desires only to be caught in flagrante. He is then dragged away to be punished for his transgressions.",
