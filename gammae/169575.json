  "description": "When JD Travis joined this gym, he wasn't sure if it would be a good fit for a guy his age. He was worried that it'd just be a bunch of young guys and that the place wouldn't really feel welcoming for him, but as soon as he meets Jack Dyer in the locker room, he realizes he's picked the perfect spot to work out his tension. Jack's got a great body, and JD suspects that he likes to squeeze in a little bit of extra work here in the locker room. Squeezing it in is just what Jack has in mind, as he eyes JD's hole when he bends over, and if he has his way, JD is about to get the workout he's been waiting for and wanting for so, so long.Enjoy!",
