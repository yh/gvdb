  "description": "Episode 5: 'Rock Show' Everyone who disappears, Oscar Wilde once wrote, seems to be seen in San Francisco. And while generations since have discovered it's a good place to leave your past behind, once you arrive oddly nothing you do is ever forgotten. Tyler (Chris Porter) came here to start over; and just as he gets his big break in his band with Ricky (Brad Star), there's a fan named Evan (Donny Wright) from his past to remind him where he came from.",
