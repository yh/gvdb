  "description": "With their parents gone for the weekend, Leeroy Jones and Elliot Finn both have party visions in their future, but before they can make the invite list, there's a bit of a pre-party happening already. With no one to interrupt them, the two step-brothers engage in a little familial bet with some hard stakes and a potentially messy outcome. And when Elliott loses, he learns that sometimes you have to pay the piper even if it means going deep in a hole.Enjoy!",
