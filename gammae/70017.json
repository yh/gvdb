  "description": "Donnie<br />As we all came to learn from both his LIVE performances as well as his scene with Jixer in Hot Zone that Donnie is all about pleasing the crowd. Donnie is very into showing off and he loves a crowd. His personality just melts the camera and the viewer and he has a way of captivating you from the start and holding your attention until he decides to let you go. His smile and those cute ears always reminded me of the funny guy in the neighborhood. This Iraq veteran is about having fun with life because he's come to realize just how short life can be. You'll cherish his boyish ways and love his manliness all at the same time. Be careful, though, his personality is addictive.",
