  "description": "'You really look nervous, Bill,' guest director Mike says, chuckling, as our new find, Bill, appears before the camera. <br /><br />Bill laughs a little bit, and Mike asks, 'Is this something new for you?' Bill quickly responds with an affirmative: 'Yep.' <br /><br />The super cute (and strapping) Bill stands 6'1' tall and weighs around 180 lbs. He's a Chicago boy and enjoys playing video games and partying around. The 'usual random bullshit,' he says. <br /><br />Mike asks Bill if he has any questions, and Bill says he doesn't. So Mike encourages him to put on a good show for him and let's him get down to it.<br /><br />Bill certainly seems nervous, but his cuteness wins over everything. If Mike is able to lure Bill back for another round, we might see him break out of his shell a little bit more! <br /><br />By the time all is said and done, Mike asks if Bill will want to come back and play some more, and Bill smiles and says, 'Yes, I will.' Well alright!",
