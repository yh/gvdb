  "description": "AJ Marshall confronts his stepson Adrian Suarez about the promise he made to get a job over the summer. It quickly backfires as Adrian is tired to get reminded of how he couldn't find work and has an idea to make his stepfather stop being on his case. He gets out pictures of AJ kissing another man and if he wants to keep it a secret, he'll leave him alone about the job... and as a bonus he'll get to fuck him.",
