  "description": "NakedSword Originals made national headlines by using its groundbreaking Golden Gate series to take on a controversial (and cute!) San Francisco politician. Now see what all the heat was about! In the season opener, Supervisor Scott Cox (Dale Cooper) wants to ban nudity in San Francisco, and not everyone's happy. During a speech in Castro's Harvey Milk Plaza, protester Logan Stevens is arrested by SFPD's Caleb Colton. But when the police van door closes, Colton realizes he's got his hands full with his seductive, naked charge. And book him he does!",
