  "description": "Cutter was one of my recent east coast finds and I've been anxious to show him off, but all things in good time, right? Well tonight is that good time and I'd like you to join me in the War Chest Update for a long, hard look at this super hot stud.I'm personally all beside myself over this one, troops. He's shy, sweet and full of smiles and he knows how to show it off. When I first approached Cutter as he stood in line in the electronics section of Wal-Mart, I gave him my card and he turned blood red and giggled. He didn't think I was serious. In fact, he later confessed that he came really close to throwing my card away. Luckily for us, he kept it and finally called.Cutter likes to wrestle, go wakeboarding and tinker around with cars. He's wrestled in a few tournaments and also likes to find time to snowboard. He wants to get into this new adventure because it sounds fun and it steps outside his boundaries.He's sportin' some great ink with an awesome sleeve that he's in the process of finishing. He's got the prettiest brownish green eyes I do think I've ever seen and he's motivated to do a good job. Such a good soldier.When he finally hauls his nice fat cock out of his boxers you'll be drooling on your keyboard. This guy is a real keeper. That huge cock stays at full attention the entire time and he cuts the cutest smiles at the camera. His cock just keeps getting bigger and bigger as he works himself up to one hell of a cumshot.",
