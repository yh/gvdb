  "description": "Light My Fire:  Ray Todd, winner of the 1972 Mr. Groovy Guy Contest, and Dave Price are both straight studs and it was not without great difficulty that this film was made.  Watching Ray and Dave become aware of each other in sexual contact is a very stimulating experience.  You can see the questioning in Ray's eyes as he is obviously asking himself why he has become so rigid over another boy.  You will enjoy the beauty of Ray's desirable body as he reaches his climax, every muscle in his body stands out.  His face displays his intense pleasure as he explodes to a climax.",
