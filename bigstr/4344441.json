  "description": "Having a new flat is amazing. Who wouldn\u00b4t like it, right? Unfortunately, Prague isn\u00b4t exactly a cheap place when it comes to rent. If you don\u00b4t choose your apartment carefully, it can really eat into your money. You can even end up like this dude. He wanted a nice place to stay with his girlfriend. They both had a good job so they decided to rent something nice. Then he got his salary slashed and she got fired. The rent was suddenly a big burden and the debt started bloating. In total desperation, he called me. I\u00b4ve never had sex with a fireman before but I expected at least a beautiful body. I wasn\u00b4t disappointed, he was amazingly ripped and hung even better.",
