  "description": "It was really not my day. I started the hunt in a rather remote area in the outskirts of Prague. Too remote as I would say now. It took me half an hour to find the first guy who I could even ask. And when I wanted to find a resto an evil thunder storm started. I was seeking shelter under a tree. Two guy were running home and I was able to stop them for a while. One of them even sold me his undies. Just the second guy convinced his friend not to go any further. Damn it. And they even told me that the resto I was looking for doesn\u00b4t even exist. Well that was bullshit as i can say now. I finally found that place and it was not really over-crowded. Good for me. The waiter was nice :-)",
