  "description": "This young man was from the Ukraine but lived in Prague for more than a decade. He came here because of the difficult situation back home; his family wanted a better life for him. After finishing schools, he worked at various construction sites but also tried some interesting jobs like being a stock broker. Shame he wasn't ambitious enough, he usually stopped working after making certain amount of money and then he chilled out until the cash run out. It's a fun way to live but you can't do it forever, that's why he asked me to find him a stable full-time job. The guy was clever and educated so it was easy. Fortunately, our mediation fee was way too high for him as his bank account was empty. I was going to have some sweet Ukrainian ass for lunch. And I don't think he minded the deal at all.",
