  "description": "Today it was already quite late when I started my hunt. Outside it was cold and rainy and for a moment I thought about staying home instead. But I changed my mind and walked to the shopping center round the corner a few minutes before closing. Not much time left for having a look around. And although it was clear that I couldn\u00b4t be too picky today I was lucky to meet a blond guy within a minute. He was nervous because of my cam but agreed to have a chat with me. He moved to Prague just recently because of the local University and he honestly wanted to become a teacher. Not bad I thought. And most important: he was quite broke and didn\u00b4t have any friends yet in Prague. And when I noticed that he was almost a bit bi-curious I decided to try my luck.",
