  "description": "There are plenty of foreigners studying at Czech universities, this young man was one of them. He was originally from Columbia but spent a few years in Czechia. He studied economics and management, also had some experience in tourism. His Czech was quite good so we had a nice chat about his career prospects. He wanted to work in finances, this was his long term goal. It's nice to meet young people who know what they want. I picked a finance advisor position for the guy; his education, knowledge of languages, and experience in dealing with people made him a perfect candidate. The guy liked the job and the good salary that came with it. He planned to support his family back home so he needed plenty of money. Such a sweet and caring young man... Now I had to figure out how to get in his pants.",
