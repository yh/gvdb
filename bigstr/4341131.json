  "description": "When that guy today opened the door I noticed right from the start that he was probably going at it before I got there. Usually I would say bye bye and leave immediately. Well, in this case the client was \"too nice\" to leave him alone with his debts :-) That poor boy was really totally broke. And as he was stupid enough to borrow money from the wrong person I realized quickly that this meeting could be especially funny.",
