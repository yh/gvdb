  "description": "Today I walked around a bus station looking for boys. After a few minutes, a young good looking guy approached me and asked me politely for 100 Crowns. He didn\u00b4t look like a homeless person at all so I started talking to him. Apparently, he came to Prague to work on some antennas or something like that. I wasn\u00b4t paying too much attention to the story, I was more interested in his cute face and nice blond hair. The poor boy stayed overnight at a hostel, where someone stole his wallet. With all the money he made the previous day. That\u00b4s why he was wandering around the city begging for money. He just wanted to buy a bus ticket home. I offered him my help and much more. He just had to go for a little walk in a park with me.",
