  "description": "I am always curious how the boys look like who called me to come. And I am always looking forward to see how they are living. When the stairs lead downstairs towards a cellar-apartment I already know that nothing good is going to expect me. Like today - what a shitty place. Both dirty and a bit smelly. The boy living there was well-dressed and educated. He was just in debts. And without a girlfriend. That was obvious from how the flat looked. He owed a lot of money to several banks and even the landlord. But it took me a while to convince him that taking such amount in return for a special favor is a good deal for him.",
